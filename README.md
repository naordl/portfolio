# Personal Portfolio & Technical Showcase

**Live Site:** [rolandnemes.com](https://rolandnemes.com)

### A Quick Overview

This portfolio is more than just a list of projects; it's a demonstration of my skills in modern web development, my commitment to user experience, and my ability to build and deploy a real-world application. It is designed to be clear, concise, and easy to navigate for both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Key Features

- **Trilingual Content (English, Hungarian, Romanian):** This feature was implemented to showcase my ability to work with internationalization (i18n) libraries and cater to a diverse audience. It reflects my language skills and my understanding of the importance of localization in modern applications. This is particularly relevant for my job search in Hungary and Romania.
- **Modern, Responsive Design:** The website is built with Next.js and BootstrapCSS, ensuring a seamless experience on any device (desktop, tablet, or mobile).
- **Dark Mode:** This popular feature is a small but important example of my attention to user preferences and my ability to implement modern UI/UX trends.
- **Interactive Project Showcase:** The portfolio includes a detailed project section with modals, image carousels, and links to live demos and source code.
- **Integrated Contact Form:** A functional contact form using Formspree is a good demonstration of my ability to integrate third-party services and handle user input.
- **Vercel Deployment:** The site is deployed on Vercel, a popular platform for modern web applications, which I hope further demonstrates my experience with CI/CD and modern deployment workflows.

### Why This Project Matters

This portfolio was built to demonstrate my ability to:

- **Take a project from concept to completion:** I handled the entire development process, from design and development to deployment and maintenance.
- **Write clean, maintainable code:** The project is well-structured and (to my knowledge) follows best practices.
- **Learn and adapt to new technologies:** I am constantly learning and experimenting with new tools and frameworks to improve my skills.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work. Have a good day!
